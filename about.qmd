The reflection should be about 5 paragraphs or so and should address:

how each mini-project ties in to other content in the course.

how each mini-project ties in with some other mini-projects (note that some mini-projects are more connected than others: you do not need to “connect” every single mini-project with every other mini-project).

your biggest take-aways from these mini-projects (these should not be copy-pasted from the “take-away” section of any of your original mini-projects: the expectation is that, now that we have gone through the entire course, your take-aways may be more sophisticated now).
